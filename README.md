## Career Ventures
Ever since a young child, Pristine enjoyed story telling. She was never talkative with others unless she was telling a story whether it was fiction or something that happened that day. She enjoyed writing them down and thought that maybe she could be an amazing writer. But because she only kept those written stories to herself, no one really supported her of that dream until it just stayed forgotten in the past. 
Another thing Pristine did at a young age was playing with wooden building blocks. Life was tough in the Philippines, hence why they weren't fortunate enough to buy Lego sets. She was very discriplined and always kept everything back to where they belong. She didn't talk much when she was little either. She had always been fond of drawing and painting but because of her struggle with Palmar Hyperhidrosis, her pages would always smudged and was difficult to be consistent with that skill. At age 12, she became interested in architecture when she first saw the Absolute World, otherwise called the Marilyn Monroe Towers, when visiting Mississauga. She did plenty of research about becoming an architect and decided to build a career in that field. Throughout her high school career, she took every course that would lead her to that opportunity in hopes that she gets accepted into University of Waterloo.
Unfortunately, nearing the end of her senior year, Pristine struggled with her mental health. She was not able to make a portfolio or scheduled an interview for her application. Thus, decided to stay for an extra year after her graduation in 2017. During grade 13, she was able to join a Europe trip to Prague, Austria and Germany using her saved up money from working part-time at Tim Hortons. Pristine was able to expand her horizon more and learned a lot about architecture from different cultures. However, at the same time she was also debating if she should go into Tourism. As the year progressed, she realized that she wasn't getting any better mentally and dropped out of grade 13. She was in a very dark place but also at the same didn't want to lose hope and only applied at Fanshawe College for Architectural Technology. In Fall 2018, Pristine started her first year of Architectural Technology. She had many plans ahead of her and was very determined for success. By her second year, she dropped out and worked at Nestle Canada as a seasonal worker. In 2020, Pristine have been accepted into a new program and is now attending Interactive Media Design.
